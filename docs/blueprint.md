- Accent color: Muted purple (#9966CC) as a gentle accent.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for its clean and modern look that is highly readable.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent task status and categories. These should be easily recognizable and match the clean aesthetic of the application.

- Subtle transitions and animations (e.g., when marking a task as complete) to provide feedback and enhance user engagement without being distracting.
